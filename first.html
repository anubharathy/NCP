<h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a Sample Story</h2>
<p><font size="-1">At least once a day black cat comes to one of us in a way that we've all come to see as a special request.<br>
It does not mean he wants to be fed or to be let out or anything of that sort.His need is for something very different.<br>
<b>If you have a lap handy , he'll jump into it; if you don't, he's likely to stand there looking wistful until you make him one.</b><br>
Once in it, he begins to vibrate almost before you stroke his back, scratch his chin and tell him over and over what a good kitty he is.</font></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:right; color:red"><font size="3">Every once in a while one of his purrs gets out of control and turns into a snort ....</p>
<br></font>
<p style="text-align:left; color:blue"><font size="4">Still,because I am a schoolman as well as a parent,i associate it especially with youngsters,with their quick,impulsive need for a <br> hug,a warm lap,a hand held out ....<br>
<u>Kids; like cats,need time to purr </u></font></p>
